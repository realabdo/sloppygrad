# SloppyGrad ðŸ¤ª : Because Perfection is Overrated

Welcome to the wild and wacky world of SloppyGrad, my attempt to learn neural networks but with sprinkles of chaos, a pinch of instability, and lots of crashes.

## What is SloppyGrad?
SloppyGrad takes inspiration from micrograd and tinygrad, and it's an autograd engine with a rebellious spirit. It aims to challenge the notion that all software must be perfect and well-behaved. The primary goal of SloppyGrad is to contribute to tinygrad. After all, the best way to truly understand something is to try and recreate it.

## Getting Started
To get started with SloppyGrad, follow these simple steps:

### Installation:

To install SloppyGrad, you can use pip:

Copy code
```
pip install sloppygrad
```
Or, if you prefer, you can clone this repository and install it manually:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sloppygrad.git
cd sloppygrad
pip install -e .
Usage:

Once installed, you can begin using SloppyGrad in your projects. Import it into your Python code


TODO:
Write a setup.py file with required dependencies to make installation even smoother.
Explore the unpredictable world of SloppyGrad, and let's see where chaos and creativity take us! ðŸš€
