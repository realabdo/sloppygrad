# SloppyGrad ðŸ¤ª : Because Perfection is Overrated

Welcome to the wild and wacky world of SloppyGrad, my attempt to learn neural networks but with sprinkles of chaos, a pinch of instability, and lots of crashes.

## What is SloppyGrad?

SloppyGrad is inspired by micrograd and tinygrad it's and autograd engine here to prove that not all software needs to be perfect and well-behaved. my goal is to contribute to tinygrad i believe the best way to learn something is to attempt to recreate it so here we go.

## Why Choose SloppyGrad?

- ðŸ’¥ Unpredictable Bugs: We believe that surprises keep life exciting, so we've included plenty of those.
- ðŸ¤ª Random Behavior: Who wants consistency anyway? Every computation is an adventure with SloppyGrad.
- ðŸ¤¯ Unusable Perfection: We don't aim for usability; we aim for a good laugh.
